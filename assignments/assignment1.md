# Assignment 1
## Domains
- Playing Football
- Exercising / fitness
- Watching sports
- Physical therapy / injury rehab  
  I tore my ACL a year ago and have dealt with persistent knee issues. There is a lot of work that goes into dealing with that, between going to physical therapy, doing at home exercises, and managing pain. 
- School work/productivity  
  As a student, school work is obviously a very big part of my life. Much of my free time is spent doing homework or studying. A big part of how productive I am is how organized and planned out I am.
- Going to restaurants  
  I like going out to restaurants with my friends and eating.  It is a fun activity that is important for my social life.
- Social media
- Nutrition
- Listening to music
- Sleeping


## Problems
- School work
  - Having a bunch of different stuff to do. It can be hard to stay organized and have a plan, including not forgetting assignments and deadlines.
    - Selected
  - Knowing what/how to study for exams
    - Not selected: too complex, depends on a lot of factors
  - Picking classes / planning out major
    - Not selected: basically course road, already a thing. 
- Going to restaurants
  - Finding a good restaurant to go to. Can be tough to decide - decision paralysis.
    - Selected
  - Knowing if I need a reservation / whether its busy or not
    - Not selected: requires restaurant buy in or third party integration
  - Dealing with constraints: budget, dietary, etc.
    - Not selected: fits more as a feature of finding a restaurant
- Physical therapy / injury rehab
  - Keeping track of at home exercises and remembering to do them. 
    - Selected
  - Flare-ups or setbacks due to trying to rehab too aggressively
    - Not selected: better managed by professionals rather than app
  - Coordinating between physical therapists, surgeons, athletic trainers, coaches, etc. 
    - Not selected: requires buy in from all of those parties, also privacy issues.


## Selected Problems
- **School Work Productivity Planner:** Students juggle assignments and exams scattered across different classes. This fragmentation makes it easy to forget small deadlines, double-book time, and start work too late. A planner that unifies due dates and tasks simplifies the process. I chose this because it is very relevant to me as a student and something I struggle with.
- **Injury Rehab Plan:** At home rehab programs are important but very easy to forget or skip after surgery. Having a daily routine to stick to is essential. I chose this because I have been through the rehab process and realize how difficult it can be.
- **Pick a Restaurant:** Groups often struggle with deciding where to eat with a massive amount of options and differing opinions. It can also be annoying to scour yelp looking for a place. I chose this because it can be a very useful way to make my life easier by not having to stress about where to eat.


## Stakeholders
- School Work Productivity Planner
  - Students: better organized, can keep track of deadlines and work to do.
  - Professors and TA’s: Fewer extension emails and late submissions.
  - Group project teammates: can depend on on-time contributions.
- Pick a Restaurant
  - Organizers: quick and easy way to pick a restaurant.
  - Restaurant owners and employees: Could see increase in business if suggested by the app.
  - People who don’t use the app but are going out to eat with someone who selected the restaurant based on the app: they want an enjoyable meal.
- Injury Rehab Plan
  - Student athletes: Can keep track of rehab, making the process easier.
  - Physical Therapists and athletic trainers: athletes will be more on top of what they need to do, staying on schedule.
  - Coaches: athletes will return to play faster and safer.

## Features
- School Work Productivity Planner
  - Calendar: have the ability to see all of your exams and due dates in one centralized place. This is helpful because it can be difficult to keep track of a bunch of different classes each with their due dates on their own websites / canvas pages. Having all of these in one place makes it much easier to see the bigger picture and plan.
  - Schedule: have the ability to add tasks and plan out what you are going to focus on at different times of the day. Planning ahead like this will lead to increased productivity.
  - Grade log: have the ability to keep track of what grades you’ve received, allowing you to calculate an estimate of an overall grade and see growth over time.
- Pick a Restaurant
  - Choose a restaurant: Give recommendations out of restaurants in the area for given constraints (budget, type of food, etc).
  - Polling: Allow people in the group to vote on which of the recommendations they want.
  - History: Keep track of where you’ve been and how the experience was.
- Injury Rehab Plan
  - Rehab routine: Prescribed exercises with sets/reps/video.
  - Pain & Load Check-ins: quick daily survey (pain 0–10, stiffness, jump/sprint exposure, etc). This allows users to track trends and see growth, while staying ahead of any potential flare ups.
  - Goals: create short and long term goals, allowing users to track progress towards them and check them off when completed.
